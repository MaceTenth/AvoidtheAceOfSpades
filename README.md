# AvoidtheAceOfSpades
Simple guessing game using JavaScript and deck of cards API


I started the web development track with codeacedemy and came across the next project:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/build-interactive-websites/modules/web-dev-interactive-websites/projects/chore-door
link to the complete game:

While working on it I thought it would be interesting to use alternating images so I looked for sources for that. 
I found the deck of cards api and managed to use random cards every time the game is played so I made changes to the 
original code and turned it into a guessing game that should be avoided.
